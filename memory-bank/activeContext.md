## Active Context

### Current work focus
Implementing column sort order persistence between kiorg sessions and updating the memory bank to reflect these changes.

### Recent changes
1. Implemented column sort order persistence feature:
   - Updated the `Config` struct to include sort preferences
   - Modified the application to save sort preferences when they change
   - Updated the application to load and apply sort preferences when creating new tabs
2. Updated the productContext.md file with the project's purpose, problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.

### Next steps
1. Test the column sort order persistence feature thoroughly
2. Consider implementing other persistence features like window size/position
3. Review and update the remaining memory bank files: systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md.

### Active decisions and considerations
*   Decided to store sort preferences in the existing TOML config file rather than creating a separate file
*   Chose to update the sort preferences immediately when changed rather than only on application exit
*   Implemented the feature in a way that maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations
*   How to best structure the systemPatterns.md file to document the system architecture and key technical decisions
*   How to document the technologies used, development setup, and technical constraints in techContext.md
*   How to track the project's progress, current status, and known issues in progress.md

### Important patterns and preferences
*   Prefer composition over inheritance.
*   Always run `cargo clippy` on every change.
*   Break code into modules logically instead of keeping all of them into large files.
*   Avoid deeply nested code structure by breaking up implementation into pure functions.
*   Write new tests whenever applicable to prevent regressions.
*   Prefer integration tests in `tests` folder over unit tests for more complex test cases.

### Learnings and project insights
*   The importance of maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation for long-term project success
*   The value of clear and concise communication within the development team
*   Persisting user preferences enhances the user experience significantly
*   The serde library makes it straightforward to serialize and deserialize Rust structs to and from TOML
*   Modular code organization makes it easier to implement new features without introducing bugs
