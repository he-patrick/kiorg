## Active Context

### Current work focus
Updating the memory bank to ensure accurate project documentation.

### Recent changes
Updated the productContext.md file with the project's purpose, problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.

### Next steps
Review and update the remaining memory bank files: systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md.

### Active decisions and considerations
*   How to best structure the systemPatterns.md file to document the system architecture and key technical decisions.
*   How to document the technologies used, development setup, and technical constraints in techContext.md.
*   How to track the project's progress, current status, and known issues in progress.md.

### Important patterns and preferences
*   Prefer composition over inheritance.
*   Always run `cargo clippy` on every change.
*   Break code into modules logically instead of keeping all of them into large files.
*   Avoid deeply nested code structure by breaking up implementation into pure functions.
*   Write new tests whenever applicable to prevent regressions.
*   Prefer integration tests in `tests` folder over unit tests for more complex test cases.

### Learnings and project insights
*   The importance of maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation for long-term project success.
*   The value of clear and concise communication within the development team.
